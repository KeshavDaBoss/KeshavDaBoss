# Pratham Yadav

Hi, I’m Pratham, a student at Army Public School Bolarum and a Vice-Captain at my school. I’m focused on creating impactful solutions to real-world problems, debating and exploring current global issues, and staying up to date with the latest technology. I enjoy working on projects that push me to think beyond the syllabus.

# Extracurriculars

My extracurricular involvement is deliberately broad and high-intensity, spanning innovation challenges and hackathons. In the 2025–26 academic year alone, I actively participated in multiple technology, innovation, and academic events, with several progressing beyond initial rounds.

| Activity / Competition | Category | Level Reached | Outcome / Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bharat Innovation Challenge 2025 by LPU | Innovation | Final Stage | Qualified for Stage 2, competing with the top 50 teams from across the country at LPU. |
| Big Bang 2026 | Innovation | Top 20 Hall of Fame Teams | Made it into the Top 20 Hall of Fame Teams out of 162 at the last round held at Coimbatore. |
| MethdAI Hackathon 2025 | Hackathon | Final Stage | 4th in final round. |
| Autonomous Hacks 26 | Hackathon | Final Stage | Qualified for Stage 2, in top 15% of participants (including many professionals). |
| Nerds Room AI Clash Campus Ambassador. | Internship | Selected | Selected as Campus Ambassador for Nerds Room. |
| Battle of Wits 2026 IIT Madras | Business Case Study | Final stage at IIT Madras | Qualified for the Final Stage at E-Summit IIT Madras. |
| E-Summit IIT Madras | Summit | Special Invite | Was invited to the E-Summit as a final stage participant at IIT Madras |
| CYFI Internship | Internship | Selected | Will be building a robotics community forum with CYFI NESTA Toys. |

## Projects

My project work is currently centred around one flagship system, SmartPark, as well as Project_Numidia, my next moderately big project, supported by a few smaller exploratory builds that served primarily as learning and experimentation phases.

SmartPark is an end-to-end intelligent parking management system designed to address real-world congestion and inefficiencies in large public parking spaces such as malls. The system uses a Raspberry Pi and an ESP32 to collect real-time data from multiple sensors deployed across different parking zones, which is then processed, stored, and visualised through a structured backend. Though it should be mentioned that it is being actively upgraded. The project focuses on practical system design, including hardware integration, data flow, database structuring, and real-time status updates, rather than theoretical simulation.  


Alongside SmartPark, I have worked on a small number of exploratory projects focused on testing specific ideas or technologies, many made for hackathons. These builds were intentionally limited in scope and were used to gain hands-on familiarity with hardware integration, logic flow, and rapid prototyping. While not flagship efforts, they contributed to the technical foundation that enabled the execution of SmartPark at a larger and more structured level.
